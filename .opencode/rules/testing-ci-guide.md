# Testing & CI Rule

**Rules:**

- Every new code file must have a corresponding unit test file.
- Run formatting & linting and fix until passed.
- Run unit tests and ensure coverage meets the required threshold (default ≥70%). Add tests for positive/negative scenarios.
- Start dependent services and ensure logs are clean.
- Apply migrations without errors.
- Develop blackbox e2e-test with input data; full API scenario must pass.

**Violations:**

- Missing unit tests.
- Coverage below threshold.
- Format/lint errors not fixed.
- Service logs contain errors.
- Migrations fail.
- E2E test fails.
