# Database & Migration Rule

**Goal:** schema changes must be explicit, versioned, traceable, and tested.

**Rules:**

- Use **Alembic** for all schema changes; never rely only on ORM metadata or manual SQL.
- Each change in a migration script with upgrade/downgrade; idempotent if possible; consistent naming/versioning.
- Include tables, columns, indexes, constraints, relationships explicitly.
- Tests must apply migrations to clean DB and validate structure & integrity (Postgres & SQLite if supported).
- Avoid destructive ops without backup; group related changes; keep scripts small; document dependencies/order.

**Violations:**

- Schema changes outside Alembic.
- Missing tests or incomplete upgrade/downgrade.
- Hardcoded schema in code.
- Drift between environments.
